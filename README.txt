Boids Simulation Program by Jade (Jack) McEvoy

The boid agents, represented as rings, flock towards each other in a 3D space. I didn't quite understand that the tweaks were supposed to be from the list of potential tweaks listed on the boids pseudocode site, so my tweak is: boids will be destroyed randomly as they get older, and new boids will be randomly spawned at a similar rate.
